****** For this challenge, your tasks are to finish designing three classes: World, City, and Citizen.

*** For this task, finish the code below so that: ✅

	- the program successfully creates a 'world' object 
	- the program successfully adds 100 cities into the world object using add_city method.
	- your program should create these cities with random city name that's 5-9 characters long and composed of alphabets. Result on Uppercase & Lowercase.
	- when a new city is created, it automatically adds 50 citizens to the city, with each citizen having a random age between 0 to 100.

*** World class needs to have ✅

	- a method called add_city - where you can pass the city name and it adds to its list
	- an attribute called cities - where this would be an array containing all the city object
	- constructor(num) - that creates num number of cities. for example new World(50) should create 50 new cities and store this.
	- a method called random_city - where it pulls out a random city object
	- a method called total_cities() - that returns the total number of cities in this world


*** City needs to have ✅

	- constructor(name) - that creates a new city with the given 'name' or if 'name' is blank, it can automatically create a random city name that's 5-9 characters long and composed of lowercase alphabets.
	- a method called add_citizen - where you can create a new citizen
	- an attribute called citizens - where this would be an array containing all the citizen objects


***Citizen needs to have ✅

	- a constructor
	- when a new citizen is created, it needs to automatically assign a random age (between 9 to 87)


Make sure your code meet all the requirements above.

Special Note: You can use ChatGpt but during the code overview we may ask you to change the variable type and function which should be easily handeled by the developer. Else you will fail the test.

Enjoy!
